        Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator
1.Overview
The Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator is an interactive tool
designed to simulate and analyze different page replacement algorithms used 
in operating systems. The simulator provides a user-friendly frontend interface that 
allows users to visualize and compare various algorithms in real time.

2.Features

Interactive User Interface – Easily input page reference strings and view results.

Multiple Page Replacement Algorithms – Supports FIFO, LRU, Optimal, and more.

Performance Metrics – Compare page fault rates across different algorithms.

Graphical Visualization – Visual representation of memory frame allocation and replacements.

Backend Processing – Efficient computation of page faults and statistics.

3.Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js)

Backend: Python (Flask/Django)

Data Visualization: Chart.js / D3.js

4.Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/page-replacement-simulator.git
cd page-replacement-simulator
Install backend dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the backend server:
python app.py
Start the frontend:
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000/.

5.Usage

Enter the number of frames and page reference string.

Choose a page replacement algorithm.

Run the simulation to see the page fault occurrences.

Analyze the results through graphical visualization.

6.Future Enhancements
